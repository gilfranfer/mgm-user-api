# MGM User Management API
We want you to build a Microservice that exposes a couple endpoints to return user information. 
We also want a simple UI to display the information.

## Endpoints:
- Endpoint to return a specific user (and all associated information): GET /users/{id}
- Endpoint to return a list of users created between a date range: GET /users?startDate={start}&endDate={end}
- Endpoint to return a list of users based on a specific profession: GET /users?profession={profession}
- (Custom) Endpoint to create user: POST /users

Find [here](https://github.com/gilfranfer/mgm-user-api/blob/master/src/main/resources/API-Specification.yml) the API Specification file.

## Project Milestones and Issues
In order to track and organize the work, I have created [Milestones](https://github.com/gilfranfer/mgm-user-api/milestones) and [Issues](https://github.com/gilfranfer/mgm-user-api/milestone/1?closed=1) in the GitHub project repository.
